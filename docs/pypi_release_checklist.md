# PyPI Release Checklist

## Before Your First Release

You better visit PyPI to make sure your package name is unused.

## For Every Release

0.  Make some pull requests, merge all changes from feature branch to master/main.

1. Create a new release on GitHub. We recommend adding the [auto-generate release notes](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/automatically-generated-release-notes) when publishing the release.

2.  Check the PyPI listing page to make sure the project displays properly. If tox test passed, this should be ok.
